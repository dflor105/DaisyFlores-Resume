        <p class="lead mb-4">I am an undergraduate at University of California Riverside majoring in Linguistics and while I have not been able to find any internships for Linguistics and so have not been able to gain any experience in Linguistic research or teaching.<br><br>

        I began my college expeirence at Moreno Valley College and Riverside City College and during my time here I worked very hard in order to graduate as soon as I could in order to continue to achieve my Bachelors in Lingusitics. I was also working my first 2 jobs during this time as well as dealing with the pandemic alongside the rest of thw world. I started out working the graveyard shift at Amazon loading heavy objects into trucks and then attending class after I got off of work and do homework until I had only a couple hours to rest and do it all over again. 
        In working this job specifically at Amazon I was able to understand what it meant to work hard under stressfull conditions and what determination really looked like as I would get off of work and instead of putting off assignments for a later date, I worked until I completed the assignmenets and felt waves of relief and accomplishment as I turned them in. 
        I was lucky enough to get into retail with my second job at Kohl's as after months of little sleep and strenuous labor was starting to affect my pysical and mental state. And I faced my own challenges at Kohl's as I now needed to be very sociable instead of the reclusive and isolated invironment that I worked in at Amazon. I now had to be more than willing to help out customers and go the extra mile for them as I was piled with work by my managers. If anything my time at Kohl's taught me to be more willing to talk to others in awkward situations and to not be afraid of asking questions. 
        I feel as though I have become a more sociable person because of my time in retail, I am not afraid to be the first to say something in a public setting. I want others to think that I am more than willing to help them resolve their issues no matter how minor they are.
        I graduated from Riverside City College in the Spring of 2021 and have since been accepted into UCR to continue my pursuit of attaining my Bachelors in Linguisitcs. And as I am taking more classes at UCR and learning to ask the right questions about language and Linguistics I see that the social aspect of retail has really helped me be someone that can be open with others and I am able to gain their trust in a short amount of time. So in the meantime of searching for an internship for teaching or Linguistic reasearch I am happy with the things that I have been able to attain from working outside of my field. But still managing to ralate it back to my major and see how from a nonacademic way I am able to attain skills that are not directly taught in a field such as Lingusitcs where human communication plays a major role but little is taugh on how to make those connections outside of textbook teachings.<br><br>

        As I am nearing the end of my time at UCR I am hopeful that I will be able to receive an internship in Lingusitic research or be able to apply myself to teaching K-12. And I am hopeful to find that whichever route I take will be the correct route for me to continue my journey in Linguistics.
